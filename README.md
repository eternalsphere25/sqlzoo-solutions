## Overview
This repository contains solutions to the SQL teaching and practice problems at [SQLZoo](https://www.sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).

## Important Note
Some of the solutions require changing the SQL engine used to run queries (the default is MySQL). 
This is due to some commands existing in some versions of SQL and not others.
Changing the engine can be done by clicking the gear at the top right of the SQLZoo page and selecting the appropriate one.
